Bug reports:

    Please report bugs below in the comment section of this blog.
    When reporting bugs, please be as accurate as possible and include any information that might help developers reproduce the issue or understand the cause of the issue:
        Bugs we can reproduce, or which cause we understand are usually fixed very easily.
        It is important to mention whether a bug happens “always”, or “sometimes”, and what triggers it.
        If a bug happens but didn’t happen before, or doesn’t happen in another distribution, or doesn’t happen in a different environment, please mention it and try to pinpoint the differences at play.
        If we can’t reproduce a particular bug and we don’t understand its cause, it’s unlikely we’ll be able to fix it.
